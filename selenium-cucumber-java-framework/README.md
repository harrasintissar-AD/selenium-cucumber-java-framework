## Overview

A custom-built QA Automation Framework developed using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **Cucumber BDD**, and **Maven**.

This project demonstrates industry-standard automation testing practices including:

* Page Object Model (POM)
* Thread-safe WebDriver management using ThreadLocal
* Event-driven screenshot capture
* Custom HTML reporting
* Element highlighting for improved visual reporting
* Configuration-driven test execution
* Dockerized ParaBank test environment
* GitHub Actions CI/CD integration
* Automated report artifact publishing

The framework was designed to provide maintainable, scalable, and readable automated tests while generating detailed execution evidence for debugging and analysis.

* Driver lifecycle management

### Configuration Management

`ConfigReader`

Responsible for:

* Loading framework configuration
* Reading environment-specific properties
* Managing execution settings

### Test Lifecycle

`Hooks`

Responsible for:

* Test setup
* Test teardown
* Report initialization
* Execution artifact cleanup

### Step Event Processing

`StepListener`

Responsible for:

* Listening to Cucumber step events
* Capturing screenshots after each executed step
* Sanitizing filenames
* Forwarding screenshots to the reporting engine

### Reporting

`ReportManager`

Responsible for:

* HTML report generation
* Screenshot embedding
* Scenario status reporting
* Report file creation

### Utilities

#### ScreenshotUtil

Captures full-page screenshots and stores them in the framework output directories.

#### HighlightUtil

Highlights web elements before screenshot capture to improve report readability and debugging.

## Automated Test Scenarios

### Registration

* Customer registration using valid information
* Validation of successful registration message
* Verification of account creation flow

### Login

* Customer login using valid credentials
* Verification of successful authentication
* Validation of account overview page

More scenarios can easily be added following the Page Object Model structure.

---

## Reporting

The framework generates a dedicated HTML report for each executed scenario.

### Report Features

* Scenario execution status
* Step-by-step screenshots
* Embedded Base64 images
* Portable HTML files
* Improved readability through element highlighting

### Report Locations

```text
target/
├── execution-report/
│   ├── Customer_logs_in_with_valid_credentials.html
│   └── Customer_successfully_registers_a_new_account.html
│
└── screenshots/
```

---

## Test Environment

Tests are executed against a Dockerized ParaBank application, providing:

* Consistent test environments
* Easy setup
* Repeatable execution
* Reduced environment-related issues

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The framework includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically executes the Selenium test suite whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Pipeline Capabilities

* Automatic test execution
* Java 17 environment setup
* Maven dependency caching
* Dockerized ParaBank deployment
* Automated Selenium execution
* HTML report generation
* Execution report artifact publishing
* Automatic environment cleanup

### Pipeline Flow

1. Checkout repository
2. Configure Java 17
3. Restore Maven cache
4. Pull ParaBank Docker image
5. Start ParaBank container
6. Verify application availability
7. Execute Selenium Cucumber tests
8. Generate HTML execution reports
9. Upload reports as GitHub Actions artifacts
10. Stop and remove Docker containers

### Workflow Location

```text
.github/workflows/automation-test.yml
```

After every successful or failed execution, generated reports can be downloaded directly from the GitHub Actions workflow artifacts.

---

## Running the Tests

Execute the entire suite:

```powershell
mvn test
```

Run with custom properties:

```powershell
mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -Dheadless=true
```

Example configuration:

```properties
browser=chrome
headless=false
base.url=http://localhost:8080/parabank
```
